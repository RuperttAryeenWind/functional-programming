# Introduction

## Monoids

A monoid is any type that has an operation taking two arguments of that type and returning a value of that type

* It has a set of things.
* It has a rule for combining the things.
* It has meta rules that ito be satisfied by the rules.

```scala
  trait Monoid[A] {
    // an identity element
    def id: A

    // an associative operation
    def op(x: A, y: A): A
  }
```

## Monads

Can there be a void return type? If so is it a real function

  Traits is more than an interface.

  Any two singleton set is isomorphic (surjective and bijective)
  hence they need not be distinguishable.

  {int} is a singleton set of Type int
  {string} is a singleton set of type string

  let f be defined from {int} --> {string}
  let g be defined from {string} --> {int}

  both f and g are total (surjective) and onto (bijective)

  Void and Nothing has no values and hence is the empty set {}

  Unit is a type and not a unit of any type
  Nil is both a type and a value and is used for references.

  Any function that returns an unit is not a function and
  is a procedure meant to cause a side effect.

  A function returning nothing is not a function and doesn't do anything.

  In FP, No Assumptions, make everything explicit
  This is common in functional programming.

  Ambiguous resolutions are not compiled.

  ```scala
  object Main {
    def init(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
      Console.out.print("Hello, world!")
    }
  }
  ```
