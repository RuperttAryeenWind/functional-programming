# Can there be a void return type? If so is it a real function

  Traits is more than an interface.

  Any two singleton set is isomorphic (surjective and bijective)
  hence they need not be distinguishable.

  {int} is a singleton set of Type int
  {string} is a singleton set of type string

  let f be defined from {int} --> {string}
  let g be defined from {string} --> {int}

  both f and g are total (surjective) and onto (bijective)

  Void and Nothing has no values and hence is the empty set {}

  Unit is a type and not a unit of any type
  Nil is both a type and a value and is used for references.

  Any function that returns an unit is not a function and
  is a procedure meant to cause a side effect.

  A function returning nothing is not a function and doesn't do anything.

  In FP, No Assumptions, make everything explicit
  This is common in functional programming.

  Ambiguous resolutions are not compiled.

object Main {
  def init(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    Console.out.print("Hello, world!")
  }
}
